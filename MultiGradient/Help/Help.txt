MultiGradient

The sub is called MultiGrad. It has two functions that go along with it.
These functions are called GetFirst and GetLast.
The sub and the two functions can be found in the second module.

To activate the gradient:
	Multigrad Object, Style, Reversed
	Object: form or picturebox (must have the line property)
	Style: 0, 1 or 2 (horizontal, vertical or diagonal)
	Reversed: True or False
Example: MultiGrad Picture1, 2, True
Example: MultiGrad Form1, 1, False

Important notes:
* The object must be in AutoRedraw = True and Scalemode = 3 (pixels)
* The object must support the Line method.
* This sub works with various dimensions of the object. That's because all positions of the pointers are relative.
* To get this working in a program, you must have:
	- The sub MultiGrad
	- The two functions GetFirst and GetLast
	- The color- and pointerdata

The sliders
- The sliderbar has 10 sliders, some are enabled, some not.
- The sliders can be moved left or right, but can never go further than another visible slider.
- Note: slider 0 and 9 can't be moved.

Pointer info
- An arrow shows wich pointer (slider) is selected.
- Click on the checkbox to enable/disable it.
- Click on the color to change the color
- The position of the sliders are in %, because their position is relative.

Gradients
A file list shows all saved gradients. Click on a name to load it.
(To delete a gradient, you must click here too - see buttons)

Buttons (toolbar)
- New: generates a new fixed gradient

- Save: The gradient can be saved, and will be stored in the list

- Delete: Remove a gradient from the list. Click in the list to remove the selected gradient.

- Rename: Renames a gradient.

- VB: This moves the color and pointerdata and a sub to the clipboard. This sub, called MultiGradData contains the colors as long value and the pointerinfo as single value.
Once copied, goto to your VB-program and paste it into the declarations section of the program.
Note that the sub is public.

- Shift: Shifts colors of the pointers

- Reverse: Reverses all colors, color 0 and 9 switch places, color 1 and 8, color 2 and 7, etc...

- Negative: Makes a negative gradient (photonegative)

- Manipulate Red: Has 3 submenus.
	- Kill Red: red component of the gradient = 0
	- Half Red: red component of the gradient is halved
	- Double Red: red component of the gradient is doubled.

- Manipulate Green: Has 3 submenus.
	- Kill Green: Green component of the gradient = 0
	- Half Green: Green component of the gradient is halved
	- Double Green: Green component of the gradient is doubled.

- Manipulate Blue: Has 3 submenus.
	- Kill Blue: Blue component of the gradient = 0
	- Half Blue: Blue component of the gradient is halved
	- Double Blue: Blue component of the gradient is doubled.

- Manipulate RGB: Has 5 submenus.
Every submenu manipulates the RGB-sequence.
(Example:Red becomes green, green becomes blue, blue becomes red)
	- RGB --> RBG: This replaces the RGB-sequence to RBG
	- RGB --> GBR: This replaces the RGB-sequence to GBR
	- RGB --> GRB: This replaces the RGB-sequence to GRB
	- RGB --> BGR: This replaces the RGB-sequence to BGR
	- RGB --> BRG: This replaces the RGB-sequence to BRG

- Select all colors: Enables all pointers. The gradient has now
10 different colors.

- Deselect all colors: Disables all pointers - except pointer 0 and 9.
The gradient has now 2 colors

- View Gradient: Opens another form to show the real thing. This gradient
can be drawn horizontal or vertically.
